module lists

// We can do some list stuff in Raskell, but it seems like we can't really do the fun stuff we could in
// haskell

import IO;

// We can do the basic stuff. Note that this means up to, not including 5 in Raskell!
public void printList()
{
	println([1..5]);
}

// But a list of evens will not work like this
public void printList()
{
	println([1,2..11]);
}
